# Visual Transformer Would Be More Robust and Explainable than Convolutional Neural Networks for Radiogenomics Task on Brain Magnetic Resonance Images

This is the repository for *`Visual Transformer Would Be More Robust and Explainable than Convolutional Neural Networks for Radiogenomics Task on Brain Magnetic Resonance Images'*.

## Getting Started

Almost all scripts in our paper are provided as jupyter notebooks. each folder contains a corresponding jupyter notebook. The exception is the 'multi_center_tools' folder, which contains Python scripts that enhance multi-domain radiogenomics analysis.


### Installing

You download the repository and run the notebook.
